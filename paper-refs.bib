abstract = {The discovery of antibiotics more than 70 years ago initiated a period of drug innovation and implementation in human and animal health and agriculture. These discoveries were tempered in all cases by the emergence of resistant microbes. This history has been interpreted to mean that antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria is a modern phenomenon; this view is reinforced by the fact that collections of microbes that predate the antibiotic era are highly susceptible to antibiotics. Here we report targeted metagenomic analyses of rigorously authenticated ancient DNA from 30,000-year-old Beringian permafrost sediments and the identification of a highly diverse collection of genes encoding resistance to {\ss}-lactam, tetracycline and glycopeptide antibiotics. Structure and function studies on the complete vancomycin resistance element VanA confirmed its similarity to modern variants. These results show conclusively that antibiotic resistance is a natural phenomenon that predates the modern selective pressure of clinical antibiotic use. {\textcopyright}2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Bacteriophages and archaeal viruses contribute, through lysogenic conversion or transduction, to the horizontal transfer of genetic material between microbial genomes. Recent genomics, metagenomics, and single cell studies have shown that lysogenic conversion is widespread and provides hosts with adaptive traits often associated with biotic interactions. The quantification of the evolutionary impact of transduction has lagged behind and requires further theoretical and experimental work. Nevertheless, recent studies suggested that generalized transduction plays a role in the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes and in the acquisition of novel genes during intra-specific bacterial competition. The characteristics of transduction and lysogenic conversion complement those of other mechanisms of transfer, and could play a key role in the spread of adaptive genes between communities.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Quick. Background: Foodborne outbreaks of Salmonella remain a pressing public health concern. We recently detected a large outbreak of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis phage type 14b affecting more than 30 patients in our hospital. This outbreak was linked to community, national and European-wide cases. Hospital patients with Salmonella are at high risk, and require a rapid response. We initially investigated this outbreak by whole-genome sequencing using a novel rapid protocol on the Illumina MiSeq; we then integrated these data with whole-genome data from surveillance sequencing, thereby placing the outbreak in a national context. Additionally, we investigated the potential of a newly released sequencing technology, the MinION from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, in the management of a hospital outbreak of Salmonella. Results: We demonstrate that rapid MiSeq sequencing can reduce the time to answer compared to the standard sequencing protocol with no impact on the results. We show, for the first time, that the MinION can acquire clinically relevant information in real time and within minutes of a DNA library being loaded. MinION sequencing permits confident assignment to species level within 20 min. Using a novel streaming phylogenetic placement method samples can be assigned to a serotype in 40 min and determined to be part of the outbreak in less than 2 h. Conclusions: Both approaches yielded reliable and actionable clinical information on the Salmonella outbreak in less than half a day. The rapid availability of such information may facilitate more informed epidemiological investigations and influence infection control practices.},

We report here how modern photolithographic techniques can be used to facilitate sequence analysis by generating miniaturized arrays of densely packed oligonucleotide probes. These probe arrays, or DNA chips, can then be applied to parallel DNA hybridization analysis, directly yielding sequence information. In a preliminary experiment, a 1.28 x 1.28 cm array of 256 different octanucleotides was produced in 16 chemical reaction cycles, requiring 4 hr to complete. The hybridization pattern of fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide targets was then detected by epifluorescence microscopy. The fluorescence signals from complementary probes were 5-35 times stronger than those with single or double base-pair hybridization mismatches, demonstrating specificity in the identification of complementary sequences. This method should prove to be a powerful tool for rapid investigations in human genetics and diagnostics, pathogen detection, and DNA molecular recognition.},

This review gives an up-to-date overview of the MinION's utility as a de novo sequencing device. It is argued that the MinION may allow for portable and affordable de novo sequencing of even complex genomes in the near future, despite the currently error-prone nature of its reads. Through continuous updates to the MinION hardware and the development of new assembly pipelines, both sequencing accuracy and assembly quality have already risen rapidly. However, this fast pace of development has also lead to a lack of overview of the expanding landscape of analysis tools, as performance evaluations are outdated quickly. As the MinION is approaching a state of maturity, its user community would benefit from a thorough comparative benchmarking effort of de novo assembly pipelines in the near future.

abstract = {BACKGROUND The short reads output by first- and second-generation DNA sequencing instruments cannot completely reconstruct microbial chromosomes. Therefore, most genomes have been left unfinished due to the significant resources required to manually close gaps in draft assemblies. Third-generation, single-molecule sequencing addresses this problem by greatly increasing sequencing read length, which simplifies the assembly problem. RESULTS To measure the benefit of single-molecule sequencing on microbial genome assembly, we sequenced and assembled the genomes of six bacteria and analyzed the repeat complexity of 2,267 complete bacteria and archaea. Our results indicate that the majority of known bacterial and archaeal genomes can be assembled without gaps, at finished-grade quality, using a single PacBio RS sequencing library. These single-library assemblies are also more accurate than typical short-read assemblies and hybrid assemblies of short and long reads. CONCLUSIONS Automated assembly of long, single-molecule sequencing data reduces the cost of microbial finishing to {\$}1,000 for most genomes, and future advances in this technology are expected to drive the cost lower. This is expected to increase the number of completed genomes, improve the quality of microbial genome databases, and enable high-fidelity, population-scale studies of pan-genomes and chromosomal organization.},

The development of resistance towards the antibiotics in use today has been a source of growing concern in the modern healthcare system around the world. To counter this major threat, there is an urgent need for discovery of new antimicrobials. Many plants, like mangroves, possess highly diversified list of natural phytochemicals which are known to have wide range of bioactivities. These phytochemicals can be good sources for the discovery of new drugs. In this study, we report the partial phytochemical characterization and antimicrobial activities of a semi-purified fraction isolated from the wood tissue of Ceriops decandra, a mangrove plant. This fraction named CD-3PM was chromatographically separated from C. decandra wood extract and was subjected to different spectral analyses to determine its partial chemical nature. The structural investigation indicates the presence of two diterpenoids, i) 3$\beta$, 13$\beta$-Dihydroxy-8-abietaen-7-one and ii) 3$\beta$-Hydroxy-8,13-abietadien-7-one in the CD-3PM fraction. The antimicrobial potential of this fraction was evaluated by microdilution-MTT assay against several organisms. Among the nine microorganisms found to be sensitive to the CD-3PM fraction, six organisms are reported to be pathogenic in nature. The CD-3PM fraction with broad spectrum antimicrobial efficacy revealed the presence of two diterpenoids and possesses potential applications in drug discovery process and food processing industries.},

While Illumina data is appropriate for many analyses, its short read length limits its ability to resolve genomic structure. This has major implications for tracking the spread of mobile genetic elements, including those which carry antimicrobial resistance determinants. Fully resolving a bacterial genome requires long-read sequencing such as those generated by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platforms. Here we describe our use of the ONT MinION to sequence 12 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae on a single flow cell. We assembled each genome using a combination of ONT reads and previously available Illumina reads, and little to no manual intervention was needed to achieve fully resolved assemblies using the Unicycler hybrid assembler. Assembling only ONT reads with Canu was less effective, resulting in fewer resolved genomes and higher error rates even following error correction with Nanopolish. We demonstrate that multiplexed ONT sequencing is a valuable tool for high-throughput bacterial genome finishing. Specifically, we advocate the use of Illumina sequencing as a first analysis step, followed by ONT reads as needed to resolve genomic structure.},

Though akin to the read-to-reference alignment problem, read-to-read overlap detection is a distinct problem that can benefit from specialized algorithms that perform efficiently and robustly on high error rate long reads. Here, we review the current state-of-the-art read-to-read overlap tools for error-prone long reads, including BLASR, DALIGNER, MHAP, GraphMap and Minimap.

We highlight the algorithmic features of these tools, as well as their potential issues and biases when utilizing any particular method. To supplement our review of the algorithms, we benchmarked these tools, tracking their resource needs and computational performance, and assessed the specificity and precision of each. In the versions of the tools tested, we observed that Minimap is the most computationally efficient, specific and sensitive method on the ONT datasets tested; whereas GraphMap and DALIGNER are the most specific and sensitive methods on the tested PB datasets.

This is true, but the real wonder is the rise of antibiotic resistance in hospitals, communities, and the environment concomitant with their use. The extraordinary genetic capacities of microbes have benefitted from man's overuse of antibiotics to exploit every source of resistance genes and every means of horizontal gene transmission to develop multiple mechanisms of resistance for each and every antibiotic introduced into practice clinically, agriculturally, or otherwise. This review presents the salient aspects of antibiotic resistance development over the past half-century, with the oft-restated conclusion that it is time to act. To achieve complete restitution of therapeutic applications of antibiotics, there is a need for more information on the role of environmental microbiomes in the rise of antibiotic resistance. In particular, creative approaches to the discovery of novel antibiotics and their expedited and controlled introduction to therapy are obligatory.},

abstract = {Plasmids are mobile genetics elements that play an important role in the environmental adaptation of microorganisms. Although plasmids are usually analyzed in cultured microorganisms, there is a need for methods that allow for the analysis of pools of plasmids (plasmidomes) in environmental samples. To that end, several molecular biology and bioinformatics methods have been developed; however, they are limited to environments with low diversity and cannot recover large plasmids. Here, we present PlasFlow, a novel tool based on genomic signatures that employs a neural network approach for identification of bacterial plasmid sequences in environmental samples. PlasFlow can recover plasmid sequences from assembled metagenomes without any prior knowledge of the taxonomical or functional composition of samples with an accuracy up to 96{\%}. It can also recover sequences of both circular and linear plasmids and can perform initial taxonomical classification of sequences. Compared to other currently available tools, PlasFlow demonstrated significantly better performance on test datasets. Analysis of two samples from heavy metal-contaminated microbial mats revealed that plasmids may constitute an important fraction of their metagenomes and carry genes involved in heavy-metal homeostasis, proving the pivotal role of plasmids in microorganism adaptation to environmental conditions.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Identification of antimicrobial resistance genes is important for understanding the underlying mechanisms and the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance. As the costs of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) continue to decline, it becomes increasingly available in routine diagnostic laboratories and is anticipated to substitute traditional methods for resistance gene identification. Thus, the current challenge is to extract the relevant information from the large amount of generated data. METHODS: We developed a web-based method, ResFinder that uses BLAST for identification of acquired antimicrobial resistance genes in whole-genome data. As input, the method can use both pre-assembled, complete or partial genomes, and short sequence reads from four different sequencing platforms. The method was evaluated on 1862 GenBank files containing 1411 different resistance genes, as well as on 23 de-novo-sequenced isolates. RESULTS: When testing the 1862 GenBank files, the method identified the resistance genes with an ID = 100{\%} (100{\%} identity) to the genes in ResFinder. Agreement between in silico predictions and phenotypic testing was found when the method was further tested on 23 isolates of five different bacterial species, with available phenotypes. Furthermore, ResFinder was evaluated on WGS chromosomes and plasmids of 30 isolates. Seven of these isolates were annotated to have antimicrobial resistance, and in all cases, annotations were compatible with the ResFinder results. CONCLUSIONS: A web server providing a convenient way of identifying acquired antimicrobial resistance genes in completely sequenced isolates was created. ResFinder can be accessed at www.genomicepidemiology.org. ResFinder will continuously be updated as new resistance genes are identified.},

@article{McManus1997,
abstract = {The mechanisms behind the development and spread of bacterial resistance to antimicrobial drugs are reviewed. The chief mechanisms by which antimicrobials act are interference with nucleic acid synthesis, binding to ribosomes, and inhibition of cell-wall synthesis and folate metabolism. Bacteria have evolved genetic and biochemical ways of resisting these antimicrobial actions. Genetic mechanisms include mutation and acquisition of new DNA. Bacteria resist antimicrobials biochemically by inactivating the drugs with beta-lactamases, acetylases, adenylases, and phosphorylases; reducing drug access sites of action by virtue of membrane characteristics; altering the drug target so that the antimicrobial no longer binds to it; bypassing the drug's metabolism; and developing tolerance. Enterococcal and staphylococcal resistance mechanisms are of particular importance clinically. There are three types of enterococcal resistance: (1) intrinsic resistance to aminoglycosides, aztreonam, cephalosporins, clindamycin, imipenem, penicillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, (2) tolerance to all cell-wall-active antimicrobials, and (3) acquired resistance to penicillin, aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, tetracycline, and vancomycin. Staphylococcal resistance to penicillins is expressed as beta-lactamase production, secretion of novel beta-lactamases, expression of novel penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) to which penicillins bind poorly, and increased production of or altered affinity to existing PBPs. Of great concern is whether newly described glycopeptide resistance can be transferred clinically from enterococci to staphylococci. Vancomycin use is discouraged to limit the spread of glycopeptide resistance. Many mechanisms are responsible for the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2018. Background: Multidrug resistance (MDR)-encoding plasmids are considered major molecular vehicles responsible for transmission of antibiotic resistance genes among bacteria of the same or different species. Delineating the complete sequences of such plasmids could provide valuable insight into the evolution and transmission mechanisms underlying bacterial antibiotic resistance development. However, due to the presence of multiple repeats of mobile elements, complete sequencing of MDR plasmids remains technically complicated, expensive, and time-consuming. Results: Here, we demonstrate a rapid and efficient approach to obtaining multiple MDR plasmid sequences through the use of the MinION nanopore sequencing platform, which is incorporated in a portable device. By assembling the long sequencing reads generated by a single MinION run according to a rapid barcoding sequencing protocol, we obtained the complete sequences of 20 plasmids harbored by multiple bacterial strains. Importantly, single long reads covering a plasmid end-to-end were recorded, indicating that de novo assembly may be unnecessary if the single reads exhibit high accuracy. Conclusions:This workflow represents a convenient and cost-effective approach for systematic assessment of MDR plasmids responsible for treatment failure of bacterial infections, offering the opportunity to perform detailed molecular epidemiological studies to probe the evolutionary and transmission mechanisms of MDR-encoding elements.},

Klebsiella pneumoniae is an opportunistic pathogen and leading cause of hospital-associated infections. Intensive care unit (ICU) patients are particularly at risk. Klebsiella pneumoniae is part of the healthy human microbiome, providing a potential reservoir for infection. However, the frequency of gut colonization and its contribution to infections are not well characterized. Methods. We conducted a 1-year prospective cohort study in which 498 ICU patients were screened for rectal and throat carriage of K. pneumoniae shortly after admission. Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from screening swabs and clinical diagnostic samples were characterized using whole genome sequencing and combined with epidemiological data to identify likely transmission events. Results. Klebsiella pneumoniae carriage frequencies were estimated at 6{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 3{\%}-8{\%}) among ICU patients admitted direct from the community, and 19{\%} (95{\%} CI, 14{\%}-51{\%}) among those with recent healthcare contact. Gut colonization on admission was significantly associated with subsequent infection (infection risk 16{\%} vs 3{\%}, odds ratio [OR]  = 6.9, P  {\textless} .001), and genome data indicated matching carriage and infection isolates in 80{\%} of isolate pairs. Five likely transmission chains were identified, responsible for 12{\%} of K. pneumoniae infections in ICU. In sum, 49{\%} of K. pneumoniae infections were caused by the patients' own unique strain, and 48{\%} of screened patients with infections were positive for prior colonization. Conclusions. These data confirm K. pneumoniae colonization is a significant risk factor for infection in ICU, and indicate ∼50{\%} of K. pneumoniae infections result from patients' own microbiota. Screening for colonization on admission could limit risk of infection in the colonized patient and others.},

In 2014, Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) launched a beta-testing program that supplied the scientific community with the first prototype of a nanopore sequencer: the MinION. Thanks to this program, several research groups had the opportunity to evaluate the performance of this novel instrument and develop novel computational approaches for analyzing this new generation of data. Despite the short period of time from the release of the MinION, a large number of algorithms and tools have been developed for base calling, data handling, read mapping, de novo assembly and variant discovery. Here, we face the main computational challenges related to the analysis of nanopore data, and we carry out a comprehensive and up-to-date survey of the algorithmic solutions adopted by the bioinformatic community comparing performance and reporting limits and advantages of using this new generation of sequences for genomic analyses. Our analyses demonstrate that the use of nanopore data dramatically improves the de novo assembly of genomes and allows for the exploration of structural variants with an unprecedented accuracy and resolution. However, despite the impressive improvements reached by ONT in the past 2 years, the use of these data for small-variant calling is still challenging, and at present, it needs to be coupled with complementary short sequences for mitigating the intrinsic biases of nanopore sequencing technology.},

abstract = {Background: Antibiotic resistance is a major health problem, as drugs that were once highly effective no longer cure bacterial infections. WGS has previously been shown to be an alternative method for detecting horizontally acquired antimicrobial resistance genes. However, suitable bioinformatics methods that can provide easily interpretable, accurate and fast results for antimicrobial resistance associated with chromosomal point mutations are still lacking. Methods: Phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed on 150 isolates covering three different bacterial species: Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli and Campylobacter jejuni. The web-server ResFinder-2.1 was used to identify acquired antimicrobial resistance genes and two methods, the novel PointFinder (using BLAST) and an in-house method (mapping of raw WGS reads), were used to identify chromosomal point mutations. Results were compared with phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing results. Results: A total of 685 different phenotypic tests associated with chromosomal resistance to quinolones, polymyxin, rifampicin, macrolides and tetracyclines resulted in 98.4{\%} concordance. Eleven cases of disagreement between tested and predicted susceptibility were observed: two C. jejuni isolates with phenotypic fluoroquinolone resistance and two with phenotypic erythromycin resistance and five colistin-susceptible E. coli isolates with a detected pmrB V161Gmutationwhen assembled with Velvet, but notwhen using SPAdes or when mapping the reads. Conclusions: PointFinder proved, with high concordance between phenotypic and predicted antimicrobial susceptibility, to be a user-friendly web tool for detection of chromosomal point mutations associated with antimicrobial resistance.},

abstract = {Nanopore sequencing technology has the potential to render other sequencing technologies obsolete with its ability to generate long reads and provide portability. However, high error rates of the technology pose a challenge while generating accurate genome assemblies. The tools used for nanopore sequence analysis are of critical importance, as they should overcome the high error rates of the technology. Our goal in this work is to comprehensively analyze current publicly available tools for nanopore sequence analysis to understand their advantages, disadvantages and performance bottlenecks. It is important to understand where the current tools do not perform well to develop better tools. To this end, we (1) analyze the multiple steps and the associated tools in the genome assembly pipeline using nanopore sequence data, and (2) provide guidelines for determining the appropriate tools for each step. Based on our analyses, we make four key observations: (1) the choice of the tool for basecalling plays a critical role in overcoming the high error rates of nanopore sequencing technology. (2) Read-to-read overlap finding tools, GraphMap and Minimap, perform similarly in terms of accuracy. However, Minimap has a lower memory usage, and it is faster than GraphMap. (3) There is a trade-off between accuracy and performance when deciding on the appropriate tool for the assembly step. The fast but less accurate assembler Miniasm can be used for quick initial assembly, and further polishing can be applied on top of it to increase the accuracy, which leads to faster overall assembly. (4) The state-of-the-art polishing tool, Racon, generates high-quality consensus sequences while providing a significant speedup over another polishing tool, Nanopolish. We analyze various combinations of different tools and expose the trade-offs between accuracy, performance, memory usage and scalability. We conclude that our observations can guide researchers and practitioners in making conscious and effective choices for each step of the genome assembly pipeline using nanopore sequence data. Also, with the help of bottlenecks we have found, developers can improve the current tools or build new ones that are both accurate and fast, to overcome the high error rates of the nanopore sequencing technology.},
